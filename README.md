# Payments

A toy web application for a payments service system.

## System Entities

### Users

The application contains three (3) user types that drives interactions with 
other entities in the system:

1. Administrator - Manages users and system configurations; has read/write access to roles, 
   users, and system configurations.
2. Biller - Manages products that will be sold to customers.
3. Customer - Product consumer.

### Products & Transactions

Billers can create products which are forms that contain fields and also contain prices.

The application also sets fee rates which effects the calculation of each transaction.

## Technical Overview

TBD: Describe the technical implementation in a high-level manner.
